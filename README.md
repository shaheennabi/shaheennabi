## Data Science Aficionado | Machine Learning & AI | Reinforcement Learning & LLM Agents Around Me | Ready to Build

Welcome to my GitHub profile! Iâ€™m a passionate data scientist with a strong focus on end-to-end projects and system design with software's best practices. I try to design and implement solutions by using design principles and patterns, as writing reusable and easy to read code wins at many stages. From my beginnings as a black hat script kiddie exploring the dark web to becoming a data scientist. My jouney has been so much challenging at every stage, but I am still learning lot of things from base, and will end up building some great projects in the future. I will be actively contributing to open-source & I believe the real world knowledge comes from solving real world problems, not just by any academmic credential.
